# wordcount

This shell script calculates the word count for a text file provided as an argument. The script should be run in the command line, with the path to a file provided as an argument.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

First, clone the repository to your machine.

   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

You can run the script immediately by using the shell command

Or you can make it executable if you prefer

The script will show an error if you either provide no arguments, or if you provide more than one argument. Stay tuned for more improvements!
